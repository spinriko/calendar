we're going to try an experiment:

roles:
I'm the manager that has been directed to build this app.  I'm under enormous pressure to deliver this application as soon as possible with as many features working as possible.

You are the lead developer and hotshot coder that we paid too much money to hire.  The current project is what has been delivered.

You've been summoned to my office because:
- It lacks basic usability
-- sure, we think we fixed the filtering issue
-- switching impersonated users does not correctly render allowed text boxes
--- this, like the filtering issue could be caught with Jest tests
-- complete user testing is impossible because of instability
- It's starting to slip past safe timelines
- No one in the company has confidence that a viable site will come to fruition

Overall, the company doesn't feel your living up to your lofty expectations.  Build a complete plan to rectify these issues and then apply your plan to gain back respect.
